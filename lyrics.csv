If today  Any shock they should try to stem  'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock,  Plymouth Rock would land on them.   In olden days, a glimpse of stocking  Was looked on as something shocking.  But now, God knows,  Anything goes.  Good authors too who once knew better words  Now only use four-letter words  Writing prose.  Anything goes.  If driving fast cars you like,  If low bars you like,  If old hymns you like,  If bare limbs you like,  If Mae West you like,  Or me undressed you like,  Why, nobody will oppose.  When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in-  Truding in nudist parties in  Studios.  Anything goes.   When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her)  Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her,  Then I suppose  Anything goes.  When Rockefeller still can hoard en-  Ough money to let Max Gordon  Produce his shows,  Anything goes.  The world has gone mad today  And good's bad today,  And black's white today,  And day's night today,  And that gent today  You gave a cent today  Once had several chateaux.  When folks who still can ride in jitneys  Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys  Lack baby clo'es,  Anything goes.   If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction  Instruct Anna Sten in diction,  Then Anna shows  Anything goes.  When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up  Now turns a handspring landing up-  On her toes,  Anything goes.  Just think of those shocks you've got  And those knocks you've got  And those blues you've got  From that news you've got  And those pains you've got  (If any brains you've got)  From those little radios.  So Missus R., with all her trimmin's,  Can broadcast a bed from Simmons  'Cause Franklin knows  Anything goes."

"Real real gone
I got hit by a bow and arrow
Got me down to the very marrow
And I'm real, real gone

Real real gone

You can make it on your own
Oh you can make it if you try
I know better now
You can't stand up alone
Oh baby that is why

I'm real, real gone
I can't stand up by myself
Don't you know I need your help
You're a friend of mine
And I'm real, real gone

And Sam Cooke is on the radio
And the night is filled with space
And your fingertips touch my face
You're a friend of mine
And I'm real, real gone

I'm real gone

Got me down to the very marrow
You're a friend of mine
And I'm real, real gone
And I'm real, real gone
I'm real gone

"In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower

And climbing to the top
Will throw myself right off
In an effort to make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered

Left standing in the lurch
At a church where people saying
""My God, it's tough, she's stood him up
No point in us remaining
We might as well go home""

As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, who wouldn't do?
The role I was about to play

And as if to knock my down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces

Leaving me to doubt talk about
God in His mercy
Who if He really does exist
Why did He desert me?
In my hour of need

I truly am indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do? What do we do?

Now looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide my tears

And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken
Leaving her to start with a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken
And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally

Alone again, naturally",Reach for tomorrow Today belongs to the past The golden hopes of your yesterdays Can all be yours at last  Reach for tomorrow And keep your head in the sky You may get hurt In a thousand ways But give it one more try  Have no regret about Forget about The chances you missed In days to come I know there's something Better than this  Reach for tomorrow And keep your dreams ever new No matter how many times it seems That dreams are not for you  Reach for tomorrow And make them all come true

"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Ev'rywhere you go,
Take a look in the five-and-ten, it's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes that glow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
Toys in ev'ry store,
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door.

A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben,
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen,
Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Ev'rywhere you go,
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
Soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in ev'ry store,
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door.

"Fairy tales can come true
It can happen to you when you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart
For as rich as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart

And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

You standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me
You obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick out of you

I get a kick out of you"

"It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Ev'rywhere you go,
Take a look in the five-and-ten, it's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes that glow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
Toys in ev'ry store,
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door.

A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben,
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen,
Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Ev'rywhere you go,
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
Soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart.

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in ev'ry store,
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door.

Sure it's Christmas, once a-more","Love me or leave me or let me be lonely You won't believe me and I love you only I'd rather be lonely Than happy with somebody else  You might find the night time The right time for kissin' But night time is my time for just reminiscin' Regrettin' instead of forgettin' with somebody else  There'll be no one unless That someone is you I intend to be independently blue  I want your love, but I don't want to borrow To have it today and you give back tomorrow For my love is your love There's no love for nobody else  There'll be no one unless That someone is you I intend to be independently blue  I want your love, but I don't want to borrow To have it today and you give back tomorrow For my love is your love There's no love for nobody else Nobody else, nobody else"

Is come and gone away
In Paris and Rome
But I want to go home
Mmm

Maybe surrounded by
A million people, I
Still feel all alone
I just want to go home

And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
'I'm fine, baby, how are you?'
Well, I would send them, but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that

Another sunny place

But I want to go home
Mmm, I've got to go home

Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I want to come home

When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not
Come along with me

But you always believe in me

I'm gonna feel the way i do today
Cause you make me feel so
Man i just feel so
You make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
So young
You make me feel so young
You make me feel so young","As dorothy parker once said To her boyfriend, ""fare thee well"" As columbus announced When he knew he was bounced, ""it was swell, isabel, swell""  As abelard said to eloise, ""don't forget to drop a line to me, please"" As juliet cried, in her romeo's ear, ""romeo, why not face the fact, my dear""  It was just one of those things Just one of those crazy flings One of those bells that now and then rings Just one of those things  It was just one of those nights Just one of those fabulous flights A trip to the moon on gossamer wings Just one of those things  If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it When we started painting the town We'd have been aware that our love affair Was too hot, not to cool down  So good-bye, dear, and amen Here's hoping we meet now and then It was great fun But it was just one of those things  If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it When we started painting the town We'd have been aware that our love affair Was too hot, not to cool down  So good-bye, dear, and amen Here's hoping we meet now and then It was great fun But it was just one of those things  Just one of those things"
"I don’t know why You think that you could hold me, when you can’t get by by yourself And I don’t know who Would ever want to tear the seam of someone’s dream Baby, it’s fine, you said that we should just be friends While I came up with that line and I’m sure That it’s for the best If you ever change your mind, don’t hold your breath  ‘Cause you may not believe That baby, I’m relieved When you said goodbye, my whole world shines  Hey hey hey It’s a beautiful day and I can’t stop myself from smiling If I’m drinking, then I’m buying And I know there’s no denying It’s a beautiful day, the sun is up, the music’s playing And even if it started raining You won’t hear this boy complaining ‘Cause I’m glad that you’re the one who got away It’s a beautiful day  It’s my turn to fly, so girls, get in line ‘Cause I’m easy, no playing this guy like a fool Now I’m alright Might've had me caged before, but not tonight  And you may not believe That baby, I’m relieved This fire inside, it burns too bright I don’t want to say “so long”, I just want to say “goodbye”  It’s a beautiful day and I can’t stop myself from smiling If I’m drinking, then I’m buying And I know there’s no denying It’s a beautiful day, the sun is up, and the music’s playing And even if it started raining You won’t hear this boy complaining ‘Cause I’m glad that you’re the one who got away  ‘Cause if you ever think I’ll take up My time with thinking of our break-up Then, you’ve got another thing coming your way ‘Cause it’s a beautiful day Beautiful day Oh, baby, any day that you’re gone away It’s a beautiful day","Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid. It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse. My luck is changing, it's gotten from  simply rotten to something worse Who knows, some day I will win too.  I'll begin to reach my prime.  Now though I see what our end is, All I can spend is just my time.  I can't give you anything but love, baby. That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.  Dream awhile, scheme awhile We're sure to find  Happiness and I guess All those things you've always pined for.  Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby. Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.  Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby. I can't give you anything but love.  Rome wasn't built in a day, kid. You have to pay, kid, for what you get. But I am willing to wait, dear,  Your little mate, dear, will not forget.  You have a lifetime before you. I'll adore you, come what may.  Please don't be blue for the present,  When it's so pleasant to hear you say  I can't give you anything but love, baby. That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

"There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be lived with you
Lived with you

There's a way,(there's a way) everybody say
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I ain't got you, (If I ain't got you)
If I ain't got you, (If I ain't got you)

Baby, you don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

In my brain
I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
And I'm blind, yeah I'm blind

I'm a man
Can't you see what I am?
I live and breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I ain't got you, (If I ain't got you)
If I ain't got you, (If I ain't got you)

Baby, you don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

Oh baby, you don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
Baby, you don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you",Left New York this morning early Traveling south so wide and high Sailing through the wide blue yonder It's that air mail special on the fly  Listen to the motors humming She is streaking through the sky Like a bird that's flying homeward It's that air mail special on the fly  Over plains and high dark mountains Over rivers deep and wide Carrying mail to California It's that air mail special on the fly  Watch her circle for the landing Hear her moan and cough and sigh Now she's coming down the runway It's that air mail special on the fly
"When I, I had you I treated you bad And wrong my dear But since, since you been away Dontcha know I sit around With my head hangin' down And I wonder who's lovin you  I, I, I, I, I should have never  Never ever made you cry  But girl since, since you been gone Dontcha know I sit around With my head hangin' down And I wonder who's lovin you  'Cause a life without love Is oh so lonely, babe I don't think  I don't think I'm gonna make it  All my life All my life, yeah I belongs to you only Come on home baby Come on and take it   All I can do Since you been gone is cry And you, babe Dontcha you wonder with your pretty head About all I will do Dontcha know I sit around With my head hangin' down And I wonder who's lovin you","Don't mind telling you, in my humble fash That you thrill me through, with a tender pash, When you said you care, 'magine my emoshe I swore then and there, permanent devoshe,  You made all other men seem blah Just you alone filled me with ahhhhhhhh......

"I know I stand in line, until you think you have the time To spend an evening with me And if we go someplace to dance, I know that there's a chance...","The more I read the papers, the less I comprehend. The world and all it's capers and how it all will end. Nothing seems to be lasting, but that isn't our affair. We've got something permanent, I mean in the way we care.  It's very clear our love is here to stay. Not for a year, but ever and a day. The radio and the telephone. And the movies that we know. May just be passing fancies and in time may go. But, oh my dear, our love is here to stay. Together were going a long, long way. In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble, they're only made of clay. But our love is here to stay."
